OPERATIONAL NOTES ON ATTACKING THE MIDNIGHT NET

These n00bs have been infecting people with their virus-infested warez
downloads for too long... it's time to take them down and expand our domain in
the process!

Notes so far:

- They've got a server running somewhere in Brazil that I think they use as a
  gateway to their network -- our buddy hydr4 was able to figure out that its
  IP is {{ hub_south_ip }}
- There's some sort of "core server" that they keep their secrets on... but
  we'll need to pop this gateway first
- We know that one of their crew uses the handle "mantic0re"


hack the planet!
